[![AdaptTable — scaffold a table for any UI kit from one engine](https://adapttable.orwamahmoud.com/media/core/tour.gif)](https://adapttable.orwamahmoud.com/react/demo/)

**[📖 Documentation](https://adapttable.orwamahmoud.com/)** · **[🚀 Live demo](https://adapttable.orwamahmoud.com/react/demo/)** · **[Get started](https://adapttable.orwamahmoud.com/react/getting-started/)**

The scaffolding CLI for [AdaptTable](https://github.com/orwa-mahmoud/adapttable).
One command detects your framework and UI kit, picks your package manager, writes a
starter table, and tells you exactly what to install.

```bash
npx @adapttable/cli init
```

```
AdaptTable — detected Mantine.

1. Install the packages:
   pnpm add @adapttable/core @adapttable/mantine @mantine/hooks

2. Scaffolded: src/PeopleTable.tsx

3. Render <PeopleTable /> and you're done.
```

Requires Node.js **22.12.0 or newer**; packed releases are tested on Node 22.12 and Node 24.

## What it does

- **Detects Angular** only when `package.json` lists `@angular/core` in
  dependencies or devDependencies **and** `angular.json` is present.
  Otherwise a declared `vue` dependency selects the Vue scaffold; other
  projects retain React. Nuxt applications are recognized and receive a module
  setup link without writing plain Vite provider files.
- **Detects your UI kit** from `package.json` — Mantine, MUI, Chakra, Ant
  Design, Radix Themes, Base UI, shadcn/ui (via `components.json`), or
  Tailwind for React; all nine shipped Angular kits; Vue Unstyled, Element Plus,
  Vuetify, Naive UI, Reka UI, shadcn-vue, Nuxt UI and Quasar for plain Vue/Vite.
  Kit detection stays within the detected framework, including in mixed projects.
- **Detects your package manager** from the lockfile (pnpm / yarn / bun /
  npm) and **prints** the right install command — it never installs
  anything itself; you run the command it shows.
- **Scaffolds** `src/PeopleTable.tsx` for React, `src/app/peopleTable.ts`
  for Angular, or `src/PeopleTable.vue` with `src/adapttable.ts` for Vue, a
  sortable starter table wired to
  the matching adapter (every optional behavior is one feature import away — see
  the docs). Pass `--force` to overwrite an existing file.
  Use `--kit <kit>` to choose a kit explicitly within the detected framework.
- **One step it can't do for you:** wrap your app in the kit's provider
  (`MantineProvider`, MUI's `ThemeProvider`, `ChakraProvider`, antd's
  `ConfigProvider`, Radix's `Theme`) if it isn't already — that's the
  most common React first-run failure. Angular setup is below.

## Vue/Vite setup

Inside a plain Vue 3.5 application:

```sh
npx @adapttable/cli init
npx @adapttable/cli init --kit element-plus
```

Explicit Vue kit identifiers: `vue-unstyled`, `element-plus`, `vuetify`,
`naive-ui`, `reka-ui`, `shadcn-vue`, `nuxt-ui`, `quasar`. Dependency detection
stays within Vue. A `components.json` selects shadcn-vue before its underlying
Reka dependency; a concrete styled-kit dependency still takes priority.

Run the printed install command, then render the generated component:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import PeopleTable from "./PeopleTable.vue";
</script>

<template><PeopleTable /></template>
```

Register the generated host setup once before mounting:

```ts
import { createApp } from "vue";
import App from "./App.vue";
import { installAdaptTable } from "./adapttable";

const app = createApp(App);
installAdaptTable(app);
app.mount("#app");
```

The starter has Name/Role sorting and a native Name filter. Each styled kit
loads its required CSS; Vuetify and Quasar register their plugins, and Nuxt UI
registers its Vue plugin and wraps the table in `UApp`. Vue Unstyled needs no
stylesheet. Naive UI and Element Plus can inherit your existing theme/locale
providers. shadcn-vue ships its compiled controls and CSS; no Tailwind build is
required for that kit.

For Nuxt UI and Quasar, init also writes `adapttable.vite.ts`. Merge its native
configuration into your host Vite configuration; it includes the Vue compiler,
so keep only one registration of that compiler:

```ts
import { defineConfig, mergeConfig } from "vite";
import { adaptTableViteConfig } from "./adapttable.vite.ts";

export default defineConfig(
  mergeConfig({/* your other settings */}, adaptTableViteConfig)
);
```

Nuxt UI's generated CSS is processed with its official Tailwind/Vite plugin;
its command includes the default Lucide icon collection and the compatible
`unifont@0.7.4` dependency. Enable router integration in the generated plugin
if your host uses Vue Router. The CLI preserves every existing generated file
unless you pass `--force`; it never rewrites `main.ts`, `App.vue` or Vite config.

These templates target plain Vue/Vite browser apps. Nuxt framework applications
use their kit's module/plugin conventions instead; init explains that setup
and writes nothing there. Quasar SSR/SSG uses Quasar CLI rather than this plain
Vite starter. See [Vue installation and providers](https://adapttable.orwamahmoud.com/vue/getting-started/).

The generated applications are verified through native production builds and
rendered interactions. An additional check of every SDK declaration with
`skipLibCheck: false` currently reports upstream declaration errors for the
Vuetify framework and Nuxt UI Vue plugin. That stronger vendor check is not
claimed as passing; init does not add type suppressions or change your tsconfig.

## Angular setup

With both Angular markers present, `init` writes a standalone `PeopleTable`
component. Installed SDK dependencies select one of the nine supported Angular
kits; without a matching SDK, it uses `@adapttable/angular-unstyled`. Use
`--kit` to choose explicitly, for example
`npx @adapttable/cli init --kit angular-material`. React kit dependencies,
Tailwind and `components.json` do not override that Angular selection.

All nine Angular kits are public npm packages. Run the printed install command
with your package manager. The CLI does not check registry availability,
install packages or edit `package.json`.

In an app component beside the generated file, import and render it:

```ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { PeopleTable } from "./peopleTable";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
  standalone: true,
  imports: [PeopleTable],
  template: "<people-table />",
})
export class App {}
```

The component uses `ColumnDef` from `@adapttable/angular` and `AdaptDataTable`
from the chosen kit, with Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing and Grace Hopper as starter
rows. Name and Role are sortable. The CLI leaves your app component,
`angular.json` and styles unchanged, and preserves an existing generated
component unless you pass `--force`.

The NG-ZORRO kit targets Angular 22 and NG-ZORRO 22.1.1. Its host peers are
`@angular/cdk`, `@angular/common`, `@angular/core`, `@angular/forms`,
`@angular/platform-browser`, `@angular/router` and `ng-zorro-antd`.
The printed command includes missing CDK/forms/router peers with Angular 22
ranges and leaves already declared peers out; match any missing Angular
peers to your installed Angular version. Load the NG-ZORRO stylesheet once
from your app's global CSS:

```css
@import "ng-zorro-antd/ng-zorro-antd.min.css";
```

The native kit requires no theme stylesheet.
For another kit, follow its provider and stylesheet instructions in the
[Angular setup guide](https://adapttable.orwamahmoud.com/angular/getting-started/).

## Migrate from v2

```bash
npx @adapttable/cli migrate-v3 src
npx @adapttable/cli migrate-v3 src --check
```

The command moves the 72 adapter-contract imports to
`@adapttable/react/adapter`. Changes that need a behavior choice are reported
with their source locations and left untouched. A second run is a no-op.

## Programmatic use

The building blocks are exported and pure (easy to test/automate):

```ts
import { detectFramework, detectKit, runInit } from "@adapttable/cli";

detectKit({ "@mui/material": "^6" }).kit; // "mui"

const dependencies = { "@angular/core": "^22.2.0", "ng-zorro-antd": "^22.1.1" };
const framework = detectFramework(dependencies, { hasAngularJson: true });
detectKit(dependencies, { framework }).kit; // "ng-zorro"
```

`runInit` reports the detected `framework` alongside its kit, generated paths
and install command. `detectKit` defaults to React when its framework option
is omitted, and existing `KitInfo` values need no new required property.

## Features

- **Detects your UI kit** from `package.json` — Mantine, MUI, Chakra, Ant Design, Radix,
  Base UI, shadcn/ui (via `components.json`) or Tailwind for React; NG-ZORRO or
  native controls for Angular.
- **Prints the exact install command** for the matching adapter plus the peer
  packages it needs; run it yourself with your package manager.
- **Scaffolds a working table** wired to your kit, not a blank file: sortable out
  of the box, with the full AdaptTable feature set (filtering, selection, editing,
  grouping, saved views, CSV export, virtualization, …) each one import away.
- **Migrates v2 source safely** — `migrate-v3` moves adapter-contract imports
  to `@adapttable/react/adapter` and reports every behavior-dependent change
  for manual review.
- **Programmatic API** — call it from your own scripts, not only the terminal.
